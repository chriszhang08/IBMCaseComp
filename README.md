# The Sustainable Financing Foundation

## Background
Small businesses and non-profits around the world are looking to make an impact, with many struggling to 
reach their goals due to lack of funding and/ or resources. What happens if a local business has to shut down
because their throughput wasn't going to be sustainable enough in the long run? What if that same business had 
an audience of loyal customers that couldn't imagine going elsewhere to find the same goods? 

This hypothetical scenario is not as imaginary as it may seem. Many businesses do in fact deal with the same
issues that end up forcing them to close their buildings and halt production. What if we told you there is a way
we can support those small businesses that we love, all for a small amount of money? 

That's where The Sustainable Financing Foundation comes in.

## Project Goal
The purpose of creating this non-profit initiative is to inspire small businesses and other non-profits to continue
achieving and setting goals, all while receiving a boost of funding from an audience of supportive members. In
this way, each member of this broad population of loyal consumers can donate anywhere between a few cents or a 
couple dollars to their organizations of interest. Adding up these donations across a wide variety of members
has the opportunity to define a paradigm shift in the world of small businesses, as these funds have the potential
to profoundly accelerate economic and entrepreneurial growth when coupled together.

## Design
This app serves as a platform with 4 different profile types: the individual contributor, the small business, the
big business, and the charitable organization. By choosing the category that best identifies you or your team,
you have the opportunity to provide and/ or receive help from other individuals on the app via a roundup system. 

### Sign Up Page

### Allocations Page
The hub for making quick and customizable donations. Here, the contributor can directly choose exactly how they
want to distribute their donations, whether it'd be by the dollar or by a percentage of their rounded up change.
You even have the option of customizing your donation settings based on your payment methods and 
types of purchases (i.e., food, gas, education, etc).

### Analytics Page
Once your round up takes effect, your donation statistics will be displayed here. This way, you can see the status of your
donations as well as your donation value over a given time period. Another interesting addition is the *impact* feature that
allows you to see exactly what your donation was used for- this can be anything from the purchase of new equipment to the
opening of new jobs! Business owners directly document this information, making it visible for contributors at the click of
a few buttons. How neat!

### Favorites Page
For the contributor, this is a page where they see all their favorite businesses and charities. Once the 
contributor favorites a business profile, they will be able to easily add that organization in their 
Allocations page so that they can provide a donation.

### Profile Page
For businesses and charities, this page is filled with mission statements, company descriptions, contact 
information, and also items/ equipment they seek funding for. For contributors, this is the place where they
can perfect their biographies and add their organizations of interest as well as features that attract them to 
those same businesses they donate to.

### Messages Page
Currently under construction. A way to communicate with your most devoted contributors or favorite businesses and 
other organizations. From the contributor's perspective, this provides you with the inside scoop on how the businesses
you're contributing to are benefitting from your funding as well as their economic progression over time.
